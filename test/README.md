# Testing AP-SVM

This directory contains notebooks for to look at the performance of the AP-SVM data cleaning model on test data. It also provides notebooks to perform sacrifice (false negative) and leakage (false positive) studies. 

## Usage

### 1. Test Overall Performance

Open the `APSVMCuts.ipynb` notebook to look at the overall performance of the AP-SVM model when performing data cleaning cuts.

### 2. Perform Sacrifice Studies

Open the `Sacrifice.ipynb` notebook to look at the physics waveform sacrifice of the AP-SVM model when performing data cleaning cuts.

### 3. Perform Leakage Studies

Open the `Leakage.ipynb` notebook to look at the anomalous waveform leakage of the AP-SVM model when performing data cleaning cuts.
