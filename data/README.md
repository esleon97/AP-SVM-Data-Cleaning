# Data for AP-SVM

This directory contains training and testing data, configuration JSON files, and serialized model and data files produced when training the AP-SVM model.

## Usage

### 1. Accessing Raw Data

Open the [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/13693791) where the raw data files are stored. Copy all of the `*_raw.h5` HDF5 files into this directory. 

### 2. Processing Raw Files

Open the `BuildDSPTrain.ipynb` and `BuildDSPTest.ipynb` notebooks to process the waveforms in the raw files. The output training files will contain normalized waveforms and approximate coefficients the discrete wavelet transform and energies of every waveform. The output testing files will contain a data cleanin label assigned by the trained SVM and an energy value for every waveform. 

## File Descriptions
